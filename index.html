            </div>
            <div class="period-content">
                <p>The fall of the Roman Empire in 467 CE marked a turning point in European literature. The <span class="highlight">Roman Catholic Church became the primary intellectual institution</span> of the medieval period. Many surviving texts are <span class="highlight">religious in nature</span>, including hymns, theological writings, and mystery plays depicting biblical stories.</p>
                
                <p>The Middle Ages also produced <span class="highlight">secular literature</span> in smaller quantities. Many texts, such as Y Gododdin and Beowulf, were based on myths or histories that had been <span class="highlight">recounted orally for centuries before being written down</span>. Christian scholars often altered these stories, adding Christian influences that would not have been present in the original oral traditions.</p>

            <div class="period-content">
                <p>The Renaissance saw an <span class="highlight">explosion of artistic and cultural activity</span> emerging from years of plague, famine, and political instability. Beginning in Italy in the 14th century and spreading across Europe, numerous discoveries in <span class="highlight">science, astrology, and geography</span> brought sweeping changes to society.</p>
                
                <p>A growing interest in <span class="highlight">humanist philosophy</span> caused intellectuals to revisit the classical works of antiquity. Around 1440, Johannes Gutenberg invented the <span class="highlight">printing press</span>, allowing literature to be reproduced and distributed on an unprecedented scale, producing up to 3,600 pages per workday compared to the previous hand-copying methods.</p>

                    <h4>Key Works</h4>
                    <p><strong>Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes</strong> - Widely considered the <span class="highlight">first example of a modern novel</span>. It follows Alonso Quixano who, after reading too many chivalric romances, becomes a knight-errant named Don Quixote. Accompanied by Sancho Panza, he sets out to revive chivalry, battling windmills he believes to be giants. The novel is a <span class="highlight">satirical exploration of idealism and reality</span>.</p>

            <div class="period-content">
                <p>During the Enlightenment, the volume of printed material significantly increased across Europe.

Science and philosophy flourished with great thinkers such as <span class="highlight">Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau</span> producing influential texts.</p>
                
                <p>By the end of the 18th century, European writers began to <span class="highlight">reject the rationalism of the Enlightenment in favor of sentimentality and imagination</span>. Starting in Germany in the late 1700s and emphasizing individual expression in art and individual rights in politics, <span class="highlight">Romanticism became Europe's dominant literary movement</span> by the beginning of the 19th century.</p>

                    <p><strong>Works by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and William Blake</strong> - Blake's "Songs of Innocence and Experience" and other Romantic works emphasized <span class="highlight">emotions, nature, and imagination</span>.</p>

                <p>Towards the end of the 19th century, realism gave way to modernism, a literary movement that continued the realist tradition of social critique but focused on <span class="highlight">form and style of writing</span> instead of plot and content. This resulted in new narrative techniques including <span class="highlight">stream of consciousness narration, non-linear storylines, and multiple viewpoints</span>.</p>
                
                <p>Modernist writers explored the <span class="highlight">effects of industrialization, war, and new technologies on society</span>. Authors like James Joyce, Franz Kafka, and Virginia Woolf broke away from past literary conventions and experimented with their works' form, style, and structure.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="period-content">
                <p>The end of World War II in 1945 generally marks the start of the postmodern period. Postmodern authors use techniques like <span class="highlight">intertextuality, parody, and metafiction</span> to continue and expand literary experimentation.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intertextuality</strong>: A literary convention where an author uses various techniques to refer to and connect the text to another.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parody</strong>: An exaggerated imitation of a work or style for comedic effect and to mock or draw attention to specific elements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Metafiction</strong>: A technique where the author draws attention to the constructed nature of the text itself.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>In European literature, many sub-movements emerged among postmodern authors, such as the <span class="highlight">Theater of the Absurd</span>, developed in reaction to the senselessness of World War II. This movement, prominent in the 1950s and 60s, presented the belief that life was essentially meaningless.</p>

                    <h4>Key Works</h4>
                    <p><strong>Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett</strong> (1953) - Often cited as one of the most important works in the Theater of the Absurd movement, capturing the essential themes of <span class="highlight">existentialism and the meaninglessness of life</span>.</p>
